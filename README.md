# Prediction-in-Time-Series-Dataset
DATASET
A time series dataset is taken for a road approximately 25km in length. The road is divided into around 100 sections for which the time series data is given corresponding to 13 parameters as taken into account by an IOT based company.

PREDICTION
Prediction in time series dataset is done using Prophet ML model which is an additive regression model with a piecewise linear or logistic growth curve trend. It includes a yearly seasonal component modeled using Fourier series and a weekly seasonal component modeled using dummy variables. Prophet is a forecasting procedure implemented in R and Python. We predict the values for parameters 9-13 for the 10th year in each road section.
